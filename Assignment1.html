		<ul>
			<li> 2 eggs </li>
			<li> 1 tbs butter </li>
			<li> 2 tbs cream </li>
		</ul>
		<h3> Method </h3>
		<ol type = "1">
			<li> Melt butter in a frying pan over a medium heat. </li>
			<li> Gently mix the eggs and cream in a bowl </li>
			<li> Once butter has melted add cream and eggs </li>
			<li> Using a spatula folds the eggs from the edge of the pan to the center every 20 seconds (as if you are making an omlette)
